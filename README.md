## ## üîß How to Build

If you want to build the executable yourself, use `PyInstaller`.

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install pyinstaller
    ```

    Ensure all system dependencies (from Method 1, Step 2) are installed. Then, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --name vadana_bomber \
    --add-binary '/usr/bin/chromedriver:.' \
    --add-binary '/usr/bin/tesseract:.' \
    --add-data '/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/5/tessdata:tessdata' \
    script_name.py
    ```
    > **Note:** The path `/usr/share/tesseract-ocr/5/tessdata` might be different on your system. Use the command `sudo find / -name "tessdata" -type d` to find the correct path.
